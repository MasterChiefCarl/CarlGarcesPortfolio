      <h3 class="work-title"><strong>Dart (with the Flutter Framework)</strong></h3>
      <p class="work-dates">September 2020 - present</p>
      <p>
        Dart one of my <strong>Main Languages</strong> where I can develop Mobile and Web Applications in one
        Programming language and convert easily to another. I use Flutter when I create Mobile front-ends with some minor backend processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main Framework in Dart is <strong>Flutter</strong> which is a cross-platform framework that allows me to
        build apps for different architectures with a single code base. Want to make a mobile app for Android and iOS?
        It is made simple to do both with Flutter. It supports Android, iOS, Windows, Linux and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is by far my favorite language to use because of the <strong>simplicity when it comes to migrating to
          different platforms</strong> and <strong>ease of use</strong>
      </p>

      <h3 class="work-title"><strong>PHP</strong></h3>
      <p class="work-dates">September 2020 - present</p>
      <p>
        PHP is my <strong>Secondary Language</strong> where I can develop Web Applications and Websites. This is more
        focused on my backend development.
      </p>
      <p>
        And with the help of the <strong>Laravel Framework</strong>, I am able to develop Web Applications and Websites
        and integrate databases like <strong>MySQL or Oracle SQL</strong> for data handling.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also able to use <strong>PHP</strong> to create a <strong>REST API</strong> for my Mobile Application.

      <h3 class="work-title"><strong>C Programming</strong></h3>
      <p class="work-dates">March 2020 - present</p>
      <p class="work-description">
        Also known as the <strong>mother of all programming languages</strong>, C was my foundation in programming. Used in creating low level codes and applications.
      </p>
      <p>My works with C are more function - based rather than ui based</p>

      <p class="work-description">
