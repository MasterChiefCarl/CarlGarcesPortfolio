    <h2>About me</h2>
    <h3>Hi, I'm <strong>Carl Benedict T. Garces</strong></h3>

      I'm was curious student who has no idea what to expect for the IT course but enrolled anyway because I have a
      dream
      to <strong>become the next "Bill Gates"</strong>. But now I am a innovator solving problems that people really
      can't see.
    </p>
    <p>
      When not busy creating code for IT assignments and creating projects. I tend to play and <strong>enjoy life to the
        fullest</strong> and
      <strong>think of something new</strong> for the future of technology. I enjoy time with my friends and family that
      keeps me happy and alive.

      <h3 class="work-title"><strong>Dart (with the Flutter Framework)</strong></h3>
      <p class="work-dates">September 2020 - present</p>
      <p>
        Dart one of my <strong>Main Languages</strong> where I can develop Mobile and Web Applications in one
        Programming language and convert easily to another. I use Flutter when I create Mobile front-ends with some
        minor backend processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main Framework in Dart is <strong>Flutter</strong> which is a cross-platform framework that allows me to
        build apps for different architectures with a single code base. Want to make a mobile app for Android and iOS?
        It is made simple to do both with Flutter. It supports Android, iOS, Windows, Linux and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is by far my favorite language to use because of the <strong>simplicity when it comes to migrating to
          different platforms</strong> and <strong>ease of use</strong>
      </p>

      <h3 class="work-title"><strong>PHP</strong></h3>
      <p class="work-dates">September 2020 - present</p>
      <p>
        PHP is my <strong>Secondary Language</strong> where I can develop Web Applications and Websites. This is more
        focused on my backend development.
      </p>
      <p>
        And with the help of the <strong>Laravel Framework</strong>, I am able to develop Web Applications and Websites
        and integrate databases like <strong>MySQL or Oracle SQL</strong> for data handling.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also able to use <strong>PHP</strong> to create a <strong>REST API</strong> for my Mobile Application.

      <p class="work-dates">June 2013 - present</p>
      <p>
        <strong>HTML 5</strong> and <strong>CSS 3</strong> are the languages I use to create my websites. This is my
        first language that led to me taking up IT.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>HTML</strong> is used to make the body of the websites I create. It is the skeleton of the websites that
        contains the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>CSS</strong> is what I use for adding decorations to my websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the projects I have mentioned above has integrated the use of HTML 5 and CSS 3. This site is made using
        HTML 5 and CSS 3.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than that, I also use <strong>Bootstrap</strong> to create my websites. I also have covered using scss
        while handling NodeJs and Angular.

      <p class="work-description">
        Also known as the <strong>mother of all programming languages</strong>, C was my foundation in programming. Used

        very easy to use and is mostly used for my Flutter applications. I also use it ocassionally for my data storage
        for Nodejs and Flutter Applications.
